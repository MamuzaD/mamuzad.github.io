### Development

This program was my gateway into learning C++. The game consists of trying to survive in an airport for a couple days because your flight got delayed.
This took heavy inspiration from the terminal movie, I only thought it was fitting to create this project after not knowing GUIs and only using a TUI.
The Terminal was my main entry into learning about random seeds, arrays, user interaction in C++, and much more.
