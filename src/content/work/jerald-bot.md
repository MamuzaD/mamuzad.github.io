### Development

The development of Jerald Bot was a new and interesting experience where I learned the process of utilizing Discord's API to create a chat bot. I continued this development further by giving added functionality to answer plant related questions with OpenAI's API endpoint to generate appropriate responses. The whole plant essence of the bot is massively due to my girlfriend and the inspiration she gave me.

This project gave me a real world opportunity to use Python to create something meaningful that my partner and I could tweak and toy about for a while.
