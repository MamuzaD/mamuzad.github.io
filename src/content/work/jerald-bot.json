    "Developed Jerald Bot, a Discord chatbot designed to answer plant-related questions, as an introduction to APIs. The project involved using Discordâ€™s API to build the chatbot and integrating OpenAI's API to generate relevant responses and Giphy's API for GIFs. Inspired by my girlfriend, I incorporated plant-themed functionality to make the bot interactive.",
    " This project gave me practical experience using Python to create a meaningful application, with an introduction to API integration. Jerald Bot serves as a fun, interactive tool for plant enthusiasts and a personal project to explore new technologies."
