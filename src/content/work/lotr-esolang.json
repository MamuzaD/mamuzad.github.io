    "Developed an esoteric programming language in TypeScript, including a lexer, AST, parser, and evaluator, inspired by a Lord of the Rings phase during winter 2024. ",
    "This project enhanced my understanding of language design and compiler construction while gaining hands-on experience with TypeScript's type system. I implemented a lexer for tokenization, an abstract syntax tree (AST) for structure, and a parser and evaluator to interpret and execute code."
