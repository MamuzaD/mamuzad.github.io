### Development

Developing Monk was a great experience. Learning a new framework such as Next.js and using the app router was an intutitive experience. I did utilize server actions in order for the Supabase Database to respond to client side actions regarding either the notes or kanban boards.

Through this project I learned using the best Next.js and React.js practices to create a SaaS and CRUD app. For server side code I used Prisma ORM and Supabase as my main components for database actions. With user authenication, Clerk provided a simple route in order for me to create the product quicker without worrying about user authenication or the organizations process. To further my learning I used Stripe as a way to provide unlimited access to users. I employed their developers API and used it to create a modal that allows for a pro tier (for free albeit).

### Background

I never have been much for writing down my tasks or anything of importance. Usually I try my best to keep it day to day to remember my best. This all stopped when I started exploring game development in junior year of highschool. I stumbled across Trello as this point and used it all throughout junior year of highschool to keep up to date with my studies. This all fell through when I realized I was updating the board more than being productive.

Then I found myself in college, realizing I needed a fast ways to create quick notes. So I decided to create an app where I could use both Trello and Notion's greatest aspect into one.
