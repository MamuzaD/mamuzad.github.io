### Development

Creating an esoteric language gave me real insight to certain aspects that all langauges contain. Adding that this was my first time using TypeScript, it was a much need benefit as using types throughout the development was helpful in regard to literals, evaluations, and the lexing process. 

Through this project, I created a process with a lexer and parser in order to interpret and evaluate statements. All of these different functions are highlighted on my <a href="https://github.com/NostalgicDani/Lord-of-The-Rings-Esolang">Github</a> each in their own scripts.

#### Background

In winter break, I underwent a bit of a Lord of the Rings phase where I reread all three books and watched the movies many times over. Due to this and because of my CS202 class at UNLV in which I was learning some more advanced C++ techniques. I was really interested in preprocessor directives and learning to reword certain parts of C++ in order to "create a new language". This itself was not that impressive so I attempted to use this information and compile it with TypeScript to develop a new esolang.
